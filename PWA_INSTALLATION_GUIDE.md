# Cricket PWA - Full Screen Installation Guide

## 🚨 **Solution: Install as PWA for True Full-Screen Experience**

Since the TWA verification is not working (common issue with GitHub Pages), here's the **guaranteed solution** for a full-screen app without URL bar:

## 📱 **PWA Installation Method (Recommended)**

### **On Android:**
1. **Open Chrome browser** on your phone
2. **Navigate to**: `https://anujloomba.github.io/bccb_refactored/`
3. **Tap the menu** (⋮ three dots in top-right)
4. **Select "Add to Home screen"**
5. **Confirm installation**
6. **Launch from home screen** - NO URL BAR! ✅

### **On iPhone:**
1. **Open Safari browser**
2. **Navigate to**: `https://anujloomba.github.io/bccb_refactored/`
3. **Tap the share button** (⬆️)
4. **Select "Add to Home Screen"**
5. **Confirm installation**
6. **Launch from home screen** - NO URL BAR! ✅

## 🔧 **Why TWA Shows URL Bar**

The APK shows URL bar because:
- **Domain verification failed** (GitHub Pages + TWA is tricky)
- **assetlinks.json not accessible** (GitHub Pages limitations)
- **Certificate fingerprint mismatch** (common with GitHub hosting)
